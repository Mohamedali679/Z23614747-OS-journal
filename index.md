 Operating Systems – Technical Journal

Welcome to my technical journal for the CMPN202 Operating Systems coursework.  
This GitHub Pages site documents my full 7-week project, including system planning, security implementation, performance testing, monitoring, automation, and final security auditing.

 Project Overview

In this project, I deploy and configure a headless Ubuntu Server inside VirtualBox and administer it remotely using my Windows laptop as a workstation via SSH.  

Across seven weeks, I progressively implement:

- Linux system configuration  
- Security hardening and access control  
- Performance evaluation under multiple workloads  
- Monitoring and automation scripts  
- Security auditing (Lynis, nmap, service inventory)  

This journal reflects both technical work and my understanding of operating system behaviour, limitations, and trade-offs.
